## Tumblr

The purpose of this homework is to leverage animations and gestures to create custom navigation. We're going to use the techniques from this week to implement some interactions in Tumblr.

Time spent: `6`

### Features

#### Required

- [x] Tapping on Home, Search, Account, or Trending should show the respective screen and highlight the tab bar button.
- [x] Compose button should modally present the compose screen.

- N/A

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I'd like to see how people implemented their compose buttons animating in, so I can perhaps find a more simple way
2. I'd love to learn how to build to my actualy phone without going through the laborious code-signing process

### Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:
